This bukkit plugin handles the reputation of all players on the server. Reputation is saved as metadata value, stored in a hashmap, and streamed to/from a file on the server during server (re)boot.

DO NOT USE! It's still in development and not yet ready for deployment. I'm simply too poor to have private repos.
